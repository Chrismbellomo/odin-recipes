    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The roman style of spaghetti carretiera is a great staple recipe to add to your arsenal. It is a simple, umami dish that uses mostly shelf stable items you can keep in your pantry.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces (40g) dried porcini mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for finishing pasta</li>
        <li>4 medium cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Large pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon finely minced fresh parseley leaves and tender stems, divided, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>one 28-ounce (795g) can whole peeled tomatoes with liquid, thoroughly crushed</li>
        <li>one 5-ounce (140g) jar olive oil-packed tuna, preferably ventresca (tuna belly), oil reserved</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pound (450g) dried spaghetti</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small heatproof bowl or measuring cup, soak mushrooms in boiling water until fully softened, about 20 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove mushrooms from soaking liquid and squeeze out excess moisture back into the bowl or measuring cup. Reserve rehydrated mushrooms and 1/4 cup (60ml) soaking liquid, making sure to dispose of any grit that has settled at the bottom.</li>
        <li>In a 5-quart pot, combine 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil, garlic, pepper flakes, and 1 tablespoon minced parsley. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until very fragrant and garlic is just beginning to turn the lightest shade of gold, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until lightly saut√©ed and fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add reserved 1/4 cup (60ml) mushroom soaking liquid, tomatoes, and 2 tablespoons (30ml) reserved tuna oil (if your tuna doesn't have that much oil, just add as much as it does), and bring to a simmer. Season with salt.</li>
        <li>In a pot of salted, boiling water, cook spaghetti, stirring frequently, until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than package recommends. While spaghetti is cooking, flake tuna into pasta sauce.</li>
        <li>Using tongs, transfer spaghetti directly into simmering sauce along with 1/4 cup (60ml) pasta cooking water, stirring to combine. Cook, stirring, until pasta is al dente and sauce has thickened, so it coats noodles and isn't watery, about 3 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup minced parsley and 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil, stirring vigorously to combine. If sauce is too thick, add more olive oil or pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring well between additions, until desired sauce consistency is reached. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>Transfer to warmed plates and sprinkle with minced parsley. Serve right away.</li>
    </ol>
